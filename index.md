### In view of God’s mercy

For my brothers and sisters in Christ

“So then, just as you received Christ Jesus as Lord, continue to live your lives in him, rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith as you were taught, and overflowing with thankfulness”

Colossians 2:6-7

## Introduction

The purpose of this study is to learn and practice what it means to abide in Christ. To take off the old self with its sinful habits and live according to the grace of God as new creations. Paul speaks this message to the church in Ephesus. He calls them to “put off your old nature which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.” It ought to be our desires as followers of Jesus to do as he asks, to take up our cross and imitate his example of holiness.

God’s purpose for humanity is to be a reflection of his glory in the world. He doesn’t do this out of selfishness, wanting more glory, as if He needs to be glorified anymore than He already is. God desires that his glory shine because as it does, his love, grace,and mercies shine. His ultimate desire and plan for the universe is one of love. As a good father, God loves his children and wants good things for them -- to be an ambassador for God is a tremendous gift and great honor. It is for our blessing that he chooses us for his purposes. That prime purpose is to abide in Him, to know the fullness of his character and to reflect his love and light in how we walk.

Believers have a great inheritance from the Father. We are called his children and receive his many blessings. By his grace and goodness, he redeems us by the blood of Jesus and handpicks us to carry out his good works and be a blessing to others. The rewards for faithfulness are plenty in this life alone, notwithstanding an eternity of oneness with the triune God. But we do not obey God begrudgingly, simply waiting for our reward. We do so cheerfully because God loved us first (1 John 4:19). When you come to a full understanding of the good news of Christ, you desire nothing more than to serve him. It is not an easy road, but one we must take even so.

Jesus commands everyone who follows him to “be perfect” (Matt 5:48). At first glance this task looks impossible. How can a sinful person become utterly sinless? Paul the Apostle, said to be the greatest Christian to ever lived, struggled with this question. Before God transformed him into that great Apostle, Paul was a Christian killer. So now, as a Christian himself, Paul grappled with the theology of forgiveness since he had done so many wrongs. He cries out in a loud voice, saying, “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Romans 7:24-25). Paul attributes his groaning to having a sinful nature. We as well have this inherent nature of sinfulness as mortal creatures. We are filled with wickedness because of our iniquity, and therefore cannot please God. But Paul is hopeful because he is forgiven and no longer worries about moral perfection.

Paul expressed his new understanding of the good news of Jesus in chapter eight: “Those controlled by the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you” (vss 8-9). Christians are blessed with the indwelling Spirit of God. We are empowered to live in a manner that is pleasing to God. Without God’s help, this would be impossible. Indeed, Jesus says, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:​26). The disciples had asked Jesus how a person can be saved if the standard to enter the kingdom of God is so high. His answer shows us that our salvation is not depended on us but is a promise from God for those who believe.

Abiding in God, then, is not striving against our temptations, fighting to never sin again, but simply to rest in what He has already done. When we are faithful to trust in the name of Jesus, he is faithful to sanctify us into his likeness (2 Corinthians 3:18). So what is it like to become like Christ?

Scripture uses the word “fullness” to capture the majesty of who the Lord is. And as we abide, we enter into that fullness. Psalm 24 compares his fullness to the created Earth in all its detail. If you think about it, what are the odds that Earth exists in such harmony? If it were not placed in such an exact distance from the Sun, life would not be possible. If it did not spin at its exact rotation, or if it did not have such a layer of atmospheres. If the Earth were any different than it is, life could not exist. But the Earth did more than that. Because of it’s miraculous characteristics, the Earth supports intelligent life. And that’s not considering the intricacy of our solar system, our galaxy, or the universe as a whole! Acclaimed physicist and mathematician reflects on this problem, “I do not feel like an alien in this universe. The more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe must in some sense have known we were coming.” The findings of modern science and the wondrous discoveries of all history suggest a purpose in nature “and that in some way we were built into it.” Over course, not everyone agrees with his thoughts, nor am I arguing here one way or another. The uniqueness of all of creation and the supernatural circumstances by which they thrive accurately depict the fullness of God.

John 1:16 relates that from his fullness, the whole glory of God in all his goodness, we receive “grace upon grace.” The purest way God shows his fullness is by his grace toward humanity. Who among us, when wronged by someone else, has as our first thought to show grace? When Adam and Eve rebelled against him in the garden, he could have wiped them out and tried again. Like building a sandcastle, he could have just brushed them away. I imagine I would have if I was in that situation. But we know that God doesn’t make mistakes. God knew from the very beginning that we would deny him and muddy his holy name. SImply because he loves us and by the fullness of his majesty and power, has the patience to show grace upon grace as a testimony to his nature.

Ephesians 3:19 speaks of the fullness of God as a product in believers from the love of Christ. This love “which surpasses knowledge” was expressed by God when Jesus was nailed to the cross on our behalf. He bore the punishment meant for us so that we could be free. By this love, God made a way for his people who are now dead in sin because of their choices to be restored into perfect unity with Him. This action declares his fullness louder than possibly anything else. It is the single most charitable and selfless thing ever to be done. The Bible says that “while we were still sinners Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8). Or while we were yet his enemies, he died for us. Jesus laid down his life for the very ones who nailed him to that tree. That’s me and you whenever we sin. The greatest humanitarians haven’t come close to such an extension of love. Truly God’s love for his people embodies his fullness. 

It’s absolutely mind-boggling to me that God invites us to enjoy his fullness. Upon the gracious act of salvation, believers are brought into a relationship with God. Colossians 2:10 says that “in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority.” Jesus offers his fullness to those who will abide in Him. As the fruit is sustained by the tree, so are people meant to find sustenance in Christ. This was the original plan in the Garden of Eden. And it’s still meant to be that way. When we abide in Christ and he abides in us, we may experience his power and love in their most potent form -- oneness with God the Father, Son, and Spirit. Therein lies the goal of this study -- to be transformed.

“Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God’s will is, his good, pleasing and perfect will” (Romans 12:2)

# Section One: Facing the Past

“Forget the former things;
 do not dwell on the past.
 See, I am doing a new thing!
 Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?
 I am making a way in the wilderness
 and streams in the wasteland.
 The wild animals honor me,
 the jackals and the owls,
 because I provide water in the wilderness
 and streams in the wasteland,
 to give drink to my people, my chosen,
 the people I formed for myself
 that they may proclaim my praise”

(Isaiah 43:18-21)

## CHAPTER ONE: Jesus is More Than Enough

Jesus is the center of the Christian faith. If Jesus is not who he claimed to be, if he did not defeat death by rising on the third day, then Christians are to be pitied more than any other men. Similarly, if we hope in Christ for personal gain in this life, we are lost (1 Cor 15:12-19). It is of utmost importance that we must check the source and direction of our faith and apply it correctly in life. Our goal as Christians therefore, is to be as like Jesus as possible, to be perfected by his blood (Heb 10:14) and abide in Him as a spiritual offering (Rom 12:1-2).
 
“Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’  (John 8:12)

People say that God works in mysterious ways. I suppose it’s true, especially concerning the context of Paul’s letter to the Romans. In it he discusses the sufferings of humanity and creation in conjunction with God’s sovereignty and forbearance. Evil and hardship exist, but God is faithful to help and lead us according to his will, “his good, pleasing and perfect will”  (Romans 12:2). 

I wrote this book because I needed to. During the COVID pandemic, I was so afraid and angry at the world, I just wanted to rest in his embrace like a baby being cradled. My shame gloomed over me and I couldn’t sleep. I was so focused on everything wrong in my life and needed a wake up call. God gave me the idea for this book one night while I was crying out to him for help. He said you already know the answer, you know to find peace from your anxieties -- abide in me as I abide in you, he said.

I started thinking about that word, “Abide,” and what it really meant. I thought of The Big Lebowski and his catchphrase, “the dude abides.” That wasn’t it. I thought of how citizens abide by the law. That wasn’t it. My imagination stretched a little and I thought of how paint abides with the wall. But that image didn’t offer truth either. Then I remembered Jesus’ story about the vine and the vinedresser. For reference you can turn to John 15:1-11. 

He uses a metaphor about a tree and its branches to explain the source of our life and spiritual growth. In verse 5, he says, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing,” Aha! I said. Abiding is so much more than obeying, being passive, or dwelling with as the dictionary suggests. With God, abiding is to find one’s entire self in the supplication of his Spirit. Like an apple tree, the branches can’t produce fruit if they are not closely connected to the tree and its roots. The Christian cannot experience the fullness of his grace and peace nor do anything that honors God without being firmly rooted in Him.

When I was a young man, about 16, I was diagnosed with cancer and a terminal infection. A few months prior my mother passed away, enduring many types of cancer since I was very little. She was my hero and when she died, everything seemed to fall apart. And then getting sick myself so soon after, it looked like God was absent. But for the six months I spent in the hospital and another year and a half of treatment, God showed me the depths of his faithfulness.

The doctors told my father that I wouldn’t live. He said there was a complication with a surgery and I contracted a deadly bacterial infection in my brain and spine. He said there was no hope.

But God in his sovereignty knew the end of the story. During that time in the hospital, God taught me how to abide in Him. He taught me to trust him even when else fails. He taught me to remain joyful amidst hardship and to look to Christ Jesus as my goal. He showed me who he is, that when I am weak,  he is strong.  God becomes your strength when you lean on him in Jesus Christ alone.  And I suppose that's what this book is about, learning how to abide in Christ and be transformed by discovering truth and living sacrificially.
Good News!
The book of John teaches, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God" (3:16-18). God desired to be restored to us so much so that he gave up what was most precious to Him so that we might be saved from a punishment we fully deserved. 

Paul adds in Romans, "but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (5:8). Verse 10 emphasizes how we were enemies of God! And he paid the price for us anyway! Never before has something so miraculous happened! Humanity is cursed by the power, presence, and eternal punishment for evil. 

This is the result of our disobedience against God. But God does not tolerate evil, so he threw humanity out of the Garden of Eden and into the world where there is all kinds of suffering and sadness. Now without God, we are doomed. Not only life a burdened life on the Earth but to exist in eternal torment in Hell. This is the fate of all humankind. So even though we are evil and enemies of God, without hope and without excuse, he of his own accord wanted so badly to be reunited with us that he opened a way for us to be redeemed.

But according to the law of God which he gave to the Hebrews, “there can be no forgiveness without the shedding of blood” (Heb 9:22). God is a just God and cannot break his own laws. And no simply animal sacrifice would work, as people did in the Old Testament to temporarily cover their wickedness. We needed a miracle. Nothing short of that could save us from our eternal doom. 

Can you imagine the resounding joy in the crowds when Jesus came to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and everyone shouted, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” (John 12:13). Because they called him “King of Israel,” it’s thought that they expected Jesus, the Messiah, to be a political deliverer and free the Jews from Roman oppression. But he came to save us eternally, not temporarily. There are so many instances in the gospels where Jesus stands on his authority over evil and death and forgives people’s sins. And most vividly, on the moment of Jesus death, when something happened in the temple: “And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom” (Matt 27:51).

The veil was a barrier in the temple between the presence of God and the people. Long story short, the sacrifice God paid on our behalf severed that chain and made a way for us to approach God and be restored as if still in the garden! To be freed from sin and doom and be brought into new life forever!!!!!!!!!

But knowing this good news as so many of us already do is not enough. This is why I’m writing this book: to document my own journey and to help others find transformation in the light of the Son. Just like being aware of a box of bandaids in the drawer isn’t enough to cover a boo-boo, we must respond to our need for forgiveness and seek Christ first, above all else (Matt 6:33).
Forgiveness and eternal life in Heaven are not given to us freely. These came at an insurmountable cost; the life of God’s own son and very being. Even though we couldn’t possibly repay God for his kindness, he does expect something from us. When Jesus was a young man, he “went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!’” His message is for us as well, so many years after. Repent and believe!

Paul gives a long exhortation about what it looks like to repent and believe (Rom 8:1-17). He describes all people as fitting into two categories, those with the mind of flesh and those with the mind of the Spirit: People who set their minds on what the body desires and people who set their minds on what the Spirit desires (vs 5). The end result of these desires, Paul concludes, are death and life respectively. Only by trusting in the redemptive power of Jesus does the Spirit give life (vs 11). Because of this gift, we have a duty in life: “but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it” (vs 12b).

This pushed me toward a study identifying the desires of the flesh and Spirit and what the Bible says they produce. For instance, desire for wealth and luxury makes one dependent on such things and creates gaping holes in a person when they’re not readily available. Consider the link between econmic recession and suicide. This is why it says in 1 Tim 6:10 that the love of money and greediness “pierces” the person “with many sorrows.” It is the root of all evil because it encourages the person to think and do things contrary to their own well-being. Consider even the person of great economic fortune. They are often under such stress that thereM is no room for happiness; identity based on gain logically leads one to never being satisfied with what one has. 

Scripture narrows down the product of every desire of the flesh. Adversely are the products of desiring the Spirit as seen below. To abide in Christ we must abandon the desires of the flesh and seek after the Spirit: “O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness” (vs 11). The mind of flesh is overwhelmed with darkness; it it there is no light. But by the gracious Spirit of God, faith cures our fear, hope enlights our shame, joy overwhelms all anger and so on and so forth. Let this be the starting point for study. We cannot abide in Christ if we are held prisoner by the mind of flesh.
