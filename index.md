## Introduction

The purpose of this study is to learn and practice what it means to abide in Christ. To take off the old self with its sinful habits and live according to the grace of God as new creations. Paul speaks this message to the church in Ephesus. He calls them to “put off your old nature which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.” It ought to be our desires as followers of Jesus to do as he asks, to take up our cross and imitate his example of holiness.

God’s purpose for humanity is to be a reflection of his glory in the world. He doesn’t do this out of selfishness, wanting more glory, as if He needs to be glorified anymore than He already is. God desires that his glory shine because as it does, his love, grace,and mercies shine. His ultimate desire and plan for the universe is one of love. As a good father, God loves his children and wants good things for them -- to be an ambassador for God is a tremendous gift and great honor. It is for our blessing that he chooses us for his purposes. That prime purpose is to abide in Him, to know the fullness of his character and to reflect his love and light in how we walk.

Believers have a great inheritance from the Father. We are called his children and receive his many blessings. By his grace and goodness, he redeems us by the blood of Jesus and handpicks us to carry out his good works and be a blessing to others. The rewards for faithfulness are plenty in this life alone, notwithstanding an eternity of oneness with the triune God. But we do not obey God begrudgingly, simply waiting for our reward. We do so cheerfully because God loved us first (1 John 4:19). When you come to a full understanding of the good news of Christ, you desire nothing more than to serve him. It is not an easy road, but one we must take even so.

Jesus commands everyone who follows him to “be perfect” (Matt 5:48). At first glance this task looks impossible. How can a sinful person become utterly sinless? Paul the Apostle, said to be the greatest Christian to ever lived, struggled with this question. Before God transformed him into that great Apostle, Paul was a Christian killer. So now, as a Christian himself, Paul grappled with the theology of forgiveness since he had done so many wrongs. He cries out in a loud voice, saying, “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Romans 7:24-25). Paul attributes his groaning to having a sinful nature. We as well have this inherent nature of sinfulness as mortal creatures. We are filled with wickedness because of our iniquity, and therefore cannot please God. But Paul is hopeful because he is forgiven and no longer worries about moral perfection.

Paul expressed his new understanding of the good news of Jesus in chapter eight: “Those controlled by the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you” (vss 8-9). Christians are blessed with the indwelling Spirit of God. We are empowered to live in a manner that is pleasing to God. Without God’s help, this would be impossible. Indeed, Jesus says, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:​26). The disciples had asked Jesus how a person can be saved if the standard to enter the kingdom of God is so high. His answer shows us that our salvation is not depended on us but is a promise from God for those who believe.

Abiding in God, then, is not striving against our temptations, fighting to never sin again, but simply to rest in what He has already done. When we are faithful to trust in the name of Jesus, he is faithful to sanctify us into his likeness (2 Corinthians 3:18). So what is it like to become like Christ?

Scripture uses the word “fullness” to capture the majesty of who the Lord is. And as we abide, we enter into that fullness. Psalm 24 compares his fullness to the created Earth in all its detail. If you think about it, what are the odds that Earth exists in such harmony? If it were not placed in such an exact distance from the Sun, life would not be possible. If it did not spin at its exact rotation, or if it did not have such a layer of atmospheres. If the Earth were any different than it is, life could not exist. But the Earth did more than that. Because of it’s miraculous characteristics, the Earth supports intelligent life. And that’s not considering the intricacy of our solar system, our galaxy, or the universe as a whole! Acclaimed physicist and mathematician reflects on this problem, “I do not feel like an alien in this universe. The more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe must in some sense have known we were coming.” The findings of modern science and the wondrous discoveries of all history suggest a purpose in nature “and that in some way we were built into it.” Over course, not everyone agrees with his thoughts, nor am I arguing here one way or another. The uniqueness of all of creation and the supernatural circumstances by which they thrive accurately depict the fullness of God.

John 1:16 relates that from his fullness, the whole glory of God in all his goodness, we receive “grace upon grace.” The purest way God shows his fullness is by his grace toward humanity. Who among us, when wronged by someone else, has as our first thought to show grace? When Adam and Eve rebelled against him in the garden, he could have wiped them out and tried again. Like building a sandcastle, he could have just brushed them away. I imagine I would have if I was in that situation. But we know that God doesn’t make mistakes. God knew from the very beginning that we would deny him and muddy his holy name. SImply because he loves us and by the fullness of his majesty and power, has the patience to show grace upon grace as a testimony to his nature.

Ephesians 3:19 speaks of the fullness of God as a product in believers from the love of Christ. This love “which surpasses knowledge” was expressed by God when Jesus was nailed to the cross on our behalf. He bore the punishment meant for us so that we could be free. By this love, God made a way for his people who are now dead in sin because of their choices to be restored into perfect unity with Him. This action declares his fullness louder than possibly anything else. It is the single most charitable and selfless thing ever to be done. The Bible says that “while we were still sinners Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8). Or while we were yet his enemies, he died for us. Jesus laid down his life for the very ones who nailed him to that tree. That’s me and you whenever we sin. The greatest humanitarians haven’t come close to such an extension of love. Truly God’s love for his people embodies his fullness. 

It’s absolutely mind-boggling to me that God invites us to enjoy his fullness. Upon the gracious act of salvation, believers are brought into a relationship with God. Colossians 2:10 says that “in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority.” Jesus offers his fullness to those who will abide in Him. As the fruit is sustained by the tree, so are people meant to find sustenance in Christ. This was the original plan in the Garden of Eden. And it’s still meant to be that way. When we abide in Christ and he abides in us, we may experience his power and love in their most potent form -- oneness with God the Father, Son, and Spirit. Therein lies the goal of this study -- to be transformed.

# Section One: Facing the Past

> “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen, the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise”
> (Isaiah 43:18-21)

## CHAPTER ONE: Jesus is More Than Enough

Jesus is the center of the Christian faith. If Jesus is not who he claimed to be, if he did not defeat death by rising on the third day, then Christians are to be pitied more than any other men. Similarly, if we hope in Christ for personal gain in this life, we are lost (1 Cor 15:12-19). It is of utmost importance that we must check the source and direction of our faith and apply it correctly in life. Our goal as Christians therefore, is to be as like Jesus as possible, to be perfected by his blood (Heb 10:14) and abide in Him as a spiritual offering (Rom 12:1-2).
 
> “Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’  (John 8:12)

People say that God works in mysterious ways. I suppose it’s true, especially concerning the context of Paul’s letter to the Romans. In it he discusses the sufferings of humanity and creation in conjunction with God’s sovereignty and forbearance. Evil and hardship exist, but God is faithful to help and lead us according to his will, “his good, pleasing and perfect will”  (Romans 12:2). 

I wrote this book because I needed to. During the COVID pandemic, I was so afraid and angry at the world, I just wanted to rest in his embrace like a baby being cradled. My shame gloomed over me and I couldn’t sleep. I was so focused on everything wrong in my life and needed a wake up call. God gave me the idea for this book one night while I was crying out to him for help. He said you already know the answer, you know to find peace from your anxieties -- abide in me as I abide in you, he said.

I started thinking about that word, “Abide,” and what it really meant. I thought of The Big Lebowski and his catchphrase, “the dude abides.” That wasn’t it. I thought of how citizens abide by the law. That wasn’t it. My imagination stretched a little and I thought of how paint abides with the wall. But that image didn’t offer truth either. Then I remembered Jesus’ story about the vine and the vinedresser. For reference you can turn to John 15:1-11. 

He uses a metaphor about a tree and its branches to explain the source of our life and spiritual growth. In verse 5, he says, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing,” Aha! I said. Abiding is so much more than obeying, being passive, or dwelling with as the dictionary suggests. With God, abiding is to find one’s entire self in the supplication of his Spirit. Like an apple tree, the branches can’t produce fruit if they are not closely connected to the tree and its roots. The Christian cannot experience the fullness of his grace and peace nor do anything that honors God without being firmly rooted in Him.

When I was a young man, about 16, I was diagnosed with cancer and a terminal infection. A few months prior my mother passed away, enduring many types of cancer since I was very little. She was my hero and when she died, everything seemed to fall apart. And then getting sick myself so soon after, it looked like God was absent. But for the six months I spent in the hospital and another year and a half of treatment, God showed me the depths of his faithfulness.

The doctors told my father that I wouldn’t live. He said there was a complication with a surgery and I contracted a deadly bacterial infection in my brain and spine. He said there was no hope.

But God in his sovereignty knew the end of the story. During that time in the hospital, God taught me how to abide in Him. He taught me to trust him even when else fails. He taught me to remain joyful amidst hardship and to look to Christ Jesus as my goal. He showed me who he is, that when I am weak,  he is strong.  God becomes your strength when you lean on him in Jesus Christ alone.  And I suppose that's what this book is about, learning how to abide in Christ and be transformed by discovering truth and living sacrificially.

### Good News!

The book of John teaches, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God" (3:16-18). God desired to be restored to us so much so that he gave up what was most precious to Him so that we might be saved from a punishment we fully deserved. 

Paul adds in Romans, "but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (5:8). Verse 10 emphasizes how we were enemies of God! And he paid the price for us anyway! Never before has something so miraculous happened! Humanity is cursed by the power, presence, and eternal punishment for evil. 

This is the result of our disobedience against God. But God does not tolerate evil, so he threw humanity out of the Garden of Eden and into the world where there is all kinds of suffering and sadness. Now without God, we are doomed. Not only life a burdened life on the Earth but to exist in eternal torment in Hell. This is the fate of all humankind. So even though we are evil and enemies of God, without hope and without excuse, he of his own accord wanted so badly to be reunited with us that he opened a way for us to be redeemed.

But according to the law of God which he gave to the Hebrews, “there can be no forgiveness without the shedding of blood” (Heb 9:22). God is a just God and cannot break his own laws. And no simply animal sacrifice would work, as people did in the Old Testament to temporarily cover their wickedness. We needed a miracle. Nothing short of that could save us from our eternal doom. 

Can you imagine the resounding joy in the crowds when Jesus came to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and everyone shouted, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” (John 12:13). Because they called him “King of Israel,” it’s thought that they expected Jesus, the Messiah, to be a political deliverer and free the Jews from Roman oppression. But he came to save us eternally, not temporarily. There are so many instances in the gospels where Jesus stands on his authority over evil and death and forgives people’s sins. And most vividly, on the moment of Jesus death, when something happened in the temple: “And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom” (Matt 27:51).

The veil was a barrier in the temple between the presence of God and the people. Long story short, the sacrifice God paid on our behalf severed that chain and made a way for us to approach God and be restored as if still in the garden! To be freed from sin and doom and be brought into new life forever!!!!!!!!!

But knowing this good news as so many of us already do is not enough. This is why I’m writing this book: to document my own journey and to help others find transformation in the light of the Son. Just like being aware of a box of bandaids in the drawer isn’t enough to cover a boo-boo, we must respond to our need for forgiveness and seek Christ first, above all else (Matt 6:33).
Forgiveness and eternal life in Heaven are not given to us freely. These came at an insurmountable cost; the life of God’s own son and very being. Even though we couldn’t possibly repay God for his kindness, he does expect something from us. When Jesus was a young man, he “went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!’” His message is for us as well, so many years after. Repent and believe!

Paul gives a long exhortation about what it looks like to repent and believe (Rom 8:1-17). He describes all people as fitting into two categories, those with the mind of flesh and those with the mind of the Spirit: People who set their minds on what the body desires and people who set their minds on what the Spirit desires (vs 5). The end result of these desires, Paul concludes, are death and life respectively. Only by trusting in the redemptive power of Jesus does the Spirit give life (vs 11). Because of this gift, we have a duty in life: “but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it” (vs 12b).

This pushed me toward a study identifying the desires of the flesh and Spirit and what the Bible says they produce. For instance, desire for wealth and luxury makes one dependent on such things and creates gaping holes in a person when they’re not readily available. Consider the link between econmic recession and suicide. This is why it says in 1 Tim 6:10 that the love of money and greediness “pierces” the person “with many sorrows.” It is the root of all evil because it encourages the person to think and do things contrary to their own well-being. Consider even the person of great economic fortune. They are often under such stress that thereM is no room for happiness; identity based on gain logically leads one to never being satisfied with what one has. 

Scripture narrows down the product of every desire of the flesh. Adversely are the products of desiring the Spirit as seen below. To abide in Christ we must abandon the desires of the flesh and seek after the Spirit: “O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness” (vs 11). The mind of flesh is overwhelmed with darkness; it it there is no light. But by the gracious Spirit of God, faith cures our fear, hope enlights our shame, joy overwhelms all anger and so on and so forth. Let this be the starting point for study. We cannot abide in Christ if we are held prisoner by the mind of flesh.

Are you still living in the flesh according to the desires of your heart? Or do you belong to Christ and now live a new life in the Spirit? Jesus says that you will know them by their fruits. Are you more faithful, hopeful, joyful, humble, peaceable, and loving? If there is anything in you that is holding onto fear, shame, anger, pride, hatred, or lust, do all you can to purge yourself and put on Christlikeness -- “this is your true and proper worship” (Rom 12:1-2)

Paul, one of the most persecuted and forlorn Christians mentioned in the Bible, declared with certainty,  “I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength” (Phillipians 4:12b-13). Do you live everyday like Paul, looking to God for strength? Or are you so torn with self-pity that you see yourself as the victim? Vulnerability before God is vital! Don’t allow yourself to make excuses as I have for so long.

As a side note, “But God” is likely the greatest transitional expression in all of the Bible. Follow the thought of this passage:

> “And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—  among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.” (Eph 2:1-3)

Not a very nice picture of humanity, is it? Doesn’t offer much hope, does it? Now look at the next verses:

> “But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved”  (Eph 2:4-5)

> “But God” is everything for the believer. It’s not like we were drowning and God gave us a raft to climb on. No, we were at the bottom of the ocean floor, DROWNED, dead as dust. But God, rich in mercy, love and grace, offers us life: 

> “The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed” (Isa 53:5)

> “But God proves His love for us in this: While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8)

But God, being rich in mercy, gave up his son, knowing full well that the very one’s he’d die to forgive would torture and kill him! He sought to satisfy justice and put away sin once and for all. It is a moment of tragic irony-- that the Messiah, the one the Jews were waiting for, the only one able to take away our iniquity, would die by the same sinner’s hands. And I’m not so sure it would be any different if you or I were instead of the people that condemned him. 

This is why we rejoice at the cross, it is forgiveness! This is why we rejoice at the empty tomb, it is freedom! Jesus is everything for the believer, and stands as our inspiration for living radically and carrying out the great commission. Without Christ, the cross, and the empty tomb, there is no hope. Without God’s great forbearance in sending his son, there is no life for anyone. Without Jesus, we are nothing. This is why we love Jesus, why we praise him and thank him for hours and hours! Recognize this: without Jesus, there is only death. We would not have forgiveness and so, would all be condemned to an eternity of suffering in Hell. So take a moment to thank God for Jesus!

Before I came to a place of peace and rest in God’s promises, bitterness consumed me. I was blinded to the rich life God offered. I knew God, but holding onto sin kept me from experiencing his fullness. I was in love with thinking myself a victim. I was in love with the darkness of pride and was therefore dead. But God! Being rich in mercy! O Lord, how great is your name in all the Earth! I’m so thankful for his mercy and grace! God raised me to new life physically by curing my cancer and infections. Exponentially more important, he gave me new life in the spirit. Jesus became the propitiation for you and for me! He shines like the sun in his radiance and glory! Where sin and death once reigned, Christ is king.

The doctors, my family and myself only saw the one outcome. We were all like children, nearsighted and ignorant. Thankfully God looks through a different lens. He is our good Father and knows what we need. Oftentimes we tell him the things we want, thinking they are essential. At the time I asked God to save me from my cancer when what I really needed was for him to save me from my sin. It’s not just a three letter word, it’s an impassable barrier between myself and God and only by the blood of Jesus am I forgiven and am now able to approach the throne of God’s grace and innumerable blessings. Thank you Lord for my cancer, for it brought me to a place where I could understand the depths of my sin and my great need for your saving grace!

Yes God healed me from my cancer. Yes he blessed me with life. But how much greater is the blessing of being forgiven! To be united with God by the blood of Jesus! All I can say is thank you, Lord, because there’s nothing in me that is worthy! “O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Rom 7:24-25). This is why I say it’s all about Jesus! This is why the world needs Jesus! This is the climax of all history! This is why he is more than enough! Whatever you’re looking for in life, Jesus is more. Whatever you’re lacking, Jesus is enough. So walk with me through an in-depth examination of our hearts before God and seek to put off the old self which is rotten with sin and put on the righteousness of Jesus Christ that saves. 

What follows is a series of self-inspections. To be transformed our minds must be renewed, as Romans 12:2 teaches. To be transformed we need to let the Holy Spirit flow through us by putting away fear, shame, anger, pride, and all sin. And walk in the newness of life by Jesus’ example, faith, hope, joy, humility, and love above all. 

The first and most formidable enemy to following after Christ, is fear - our starting point to being transformed.

## CHAPTER TWO: Fear

It’s strange how normal things like a washing machine can be terrifying to a little child. Fear transforms simple things into dangerous monsters, even for adults! Why do people jump out of their skin when they see a spider? Odds are high that it’s not aiming to hurt you, nor can it. But for some reason they’re a source of great fear. Simply put, “fear is an uneasiness of mind, upon the thought of future harm likely to befall us. Fear is the passion of our nature which excites us to provide for our security, on the approach of evil.”  It, however, has no place in our lives because of Christ.

> The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?”  
> (Psalm 27:1)

A famous study from 1973 conducted by R.H. Bruskin Associates found that American’s fear public speaking more than death. The subjects of their survey would rather die than give a presentation! That is the crippling effect of fear. The pressure of public speaking overwhelmed these people so intensely and likely clouded their judgement, because I don’t think a person, if presented the task of presenting in front of a crowd, would really rather die. 

Right now in this time of Covid 19 fear plagues the entire world. Thankfully we have the vaccines now, but just a few months ago, the news was ablaze with violent warnings. Stay inside! Don’t go out! Be afraid, be very afraid! Fear drove us to attack each other. Social media blew up with arguments and discord, blame shifting and name calling. Whatever your stance on the matter, it stands that fear has power, especially when there is little understanding.

This makes me think of that scene in Home Alone where Kevin goes into the basement and sees the furnace. In his imaginings, it’s malicious and alive. It growls and roars at him and becomes a great threat. Later in the movie, he confronts his fear and finds that the furnace is nothing more than just that. Not all of our fears are so easily thwarted, however the solution is the same. If we frame our fears in the truth of God’s sovereignty, they cannot stand. In the light of the Son, darkness cannot stand (John 1:5). Confront your fears, give them no power by acknowledging his.

How do we do this exactly? A lot of times the deep things of life are impossible to understand fully, especially the depths of the mind. And fear is so widespread! A study conducted with Chapman University to discover the most common fears in America found that “In 2018 and 2019, all the top ten fears were held by more than half of Americans. There has been a noticeable increase in people who share these fears. The study concludes, “Americans are becoming more afraid .” I can only assume the percentages have gotten worse with the rise of COVID and isolation. And not only so! According to a 2021 study by Mental Health America, people are reaching out for help with anxiety and depression more than ever. Of all the groups surveyed, young people ages 11-17 ranked highest for moderate to severe symptoms . Contributing factors are the COVID virus, money concerns, and the top factor, deprivation of social interaction: “From April to September 2020, among people who screened with moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression, 70 percent reported that one of the top three things contributing to their mental health concerns was loneliness or isolation,” myself included!

When she was alive, my mother was my hero. She was my foundation and stood in the place of my heart only God deserves. So whenever her condition relapsed, fear of losing her drove me mad. Fear of being left alone kept me bound. There were many times when suicide crossed my mind, thankfully (and ironically), I was too afraid to go through with it. That anxiety stayed with me long after she died, manifesting primarily in prolonged isolation and nightmares. I was participating in church, even serving in youth ministry during those years, and nothing seemed to help. I was sans help, helpless even, to live the fearless life I was called by God to live.

This is a hard truth to swallow: when we fear, we sin against God. Jesus said, “Be anxious for nothing!” This is a command. When we submit to our fears and worries instead of God, we are in direct disobedience. And sinful fear creates sinful worship. If I’m afraid of heights (which I am), I’m bowing to the power of my fear instead of resting in Him. If I’m uneasy around big dogs (which I am), I’m letting my fear get the best of me. 2 Timothy 1:7 teaches, “God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” When I’m afraid, I deny the spirit God gave me.

I remember so many times when I was tempted to fear in the hospital. Like I said, I was there for six months, and feelings of powerlessness loomed in my room all of the time. I remember feeling caged by uncertainty. But God did not give me a spirit of fear. God did not put me in that place to wallow in self-pity or to cast blame on the hospital for letting me get that deadly infection. Simply put, God put me there for an eternal reason: to get my heart submitted to him and to be a testimony to others of his faithfulness.

Beware of being caged by your fears. To fight fear we need to understand fear. I came across two anagrams which offer a proper perspective. The first is this:

### False Evidence Appearing Real

Anderson (1999) shares an example. He talks about a man who grabbed a snake off of the ground and put it in a jar as a trophy. He later discovered that this particular species of snake is very poisonous and nearly had a heart attack (p. 14-15). In order for a fear to present a legitimate threat,  it must possess two qualities: immanency (nearness) and potency (powerful). Our fears are no longer legitimate when one of these attributes is removed. Scripture teaches that we have no need to fear because God removes one of these attributes. For example, the reality of death is imminent, but the power of death has been broken (1 Cor 15:54-55) (Neil Anderson, 1999, p. 14; 15; 16). When truth is applied, fear disappears. 
 
I am not afraid of drowning, nor of bears, nor any danger around me because I’m not afraid of being hurt or killed. This DOES NOT mean I have no understanding of the danger or run to it. To fear is to obsess irrationally and give the object power over your peace. To have caution is to have a healthy awareness of our surroundings and any present danger, maintaining control. I don’t think the man in the story would have picked up the snake had he known it was poisonous. Had he had caution, he would have avoided the snake and fear would not have taken root. Most of our fears revolve around things we can’t control. Trust God, who is in control of all things at all times, and there is no need to be afraid of anything!

The truth of scripture understands fear as a matter of submitting. It is a sin to be controlled by fear because in doing so, we worship something else. People fear living without, so they worship money. We fear not being accepted, not being beautiful enough or successful enough, so we idolize celebrities, magazine models, and people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. We fear creepy crawlies and other scary things because we do not fully understand God’s design and so idolize our own preferences. Do you think Adam and Eve were scared of the carnivorous beasts and harmful plants around them? Of course not, because they knew that God was with them and everything he made was good. To have a correct perspective, we must change our thinking on such things. Romans 12:1-2, famous passage, says, “Do not conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind so that you may test and approve what is the will of God, what is good, pleasing and perfect.” Reorienting one’s fears in light of God’s presence and the amazing gift of his son Jesus brings salvation and healing and is the first step to transformation. Unholy fear manifested horrors in me; it’s power was terrible. It will take charge over your life, but only if you let it. But God (there’s that transitional expression again!) used that fear for a purpose in my life, and I believe he can do the same for you.
