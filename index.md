## Introduction

The purpose of this study is to learn and practice what it means to abide in Christ. To take off the old self with its sinful habits and live according to the grace of God as new creations. Paul speaks this message to the church in Ephesus. He calls them to “put off your old nature which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful lusts and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and put on the new nature, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.” It ought to be our desires as followers of Jesus to do as he asks, to take up our cross and imitate his example of holiness.

God’s purpose for humanity is to be a reflection of his glory in the world. He doesn’t do this out of selfishness, wanting more glory, as if He needs to be glorified anymore than He already is. God desires that his glory shine because as it does, his love, grace,and mercies shine. His ultimate desire and plan for the universe is one of love. As a good father, God loves his children and wants good things for them -- to be an ambassador for God is a tremendous gift and great honor. It is for our blessing that he chooses us for his purposes. That prime purpose is to abide in Him, to know the fullness of his character and to reflect his love and light in how we walk.

Believers have a great inheritance from the Father. We are called his children and receive his many blessings. By his grace and goodness, he redeems us by the blood of Jesus and handpicks us to carry out his good works and be a blessing to others. The rewards for faithfulness are plenty in this life alone, notwithstanding an eternity of oneness with the triune God. But we do not obey God begrudgingly, simply waiting for our reward. We do so cheerfully because God loved us first (1 John 4:19). When you come to a full understanding of the good news of Christ, you desire nothing more than to serve him. It is not an easy road, but one we must take even so.

Jesus commands everyone who follows him to “be perfect” (Matt 5:48). At first glance this task looks impossible. How can a sinful person become utterly sinless? Paul the Apostle, said to be the greatest Christian to ever lived, struggled with this question. Before God transformed him into that great Apostle, Paul was a Christian killer. So now, as a Christian himself, Paul grappled with the theology of forgiveness since he had done so many wrongs. He cries out in a loud voice, saying, “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Romans 7:24-25). Paul attributes his groaning to having a sinful nature. We as well have this inherent nature of sinfulness as mortal creatures. We are filled with wickedness because of our iniquity, and therefore cannot please God. But Paul is hopeful because he is forgiven and no longer worries about moral perfection.

Paul expressed his new understanding of the good news of Jesus in chapter eight: “Those controlled by the flesh cannot please God. You, however, are controlled not by the flesh, but by the Spirit, if the Spirit of God lives in you” (vss 8-9). Christians are blessed with the indwelling Spirit of God. We are empowered to live in a manner that is pleasing to God. Without God’s help, this would be impossible. Indeed, Jesus says, “With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible” (Matthew 19:​26). The disciples had asked Jesus how a person can be saved if the standard to enter the kingdom of God is so high. His answer shows us that our salvation is not depended on us but is a promise from God for those who believe.

Abiding in God, then, is not striving against our temptations, fighting to never sin again, but simply to rest in what He has already done. When we are faithful to trust in the name of Jesus, he is faithful to sanctify us into his likeness (2 Corinthians 3:18). So what is it like to become like Christ?

Scripture uses the word “fullness” to capture the majesty of who the Lord is. And as we abide, we enter into that fullness. Psalm 24 compares his fullness to the created Earth in all its detail. If you think about it, what are the odds that Earth exists in such harmony? If it were not placed in such an exact distance from the Sun, life would not be possible. If it did not spin at its exact rotation, or if it did not have such a layer of atmospheres. If the Earth were any different than it is, life could not exist. But the Earth did more than that. Because of it’s miraculous characteristics, the Earth supports intelligent life. And that’s not considering the intricacy of our solar system, our galaxy, or the universe as a whole! Acclaimed physicist and mathematician reflects on this problem, “I do not feel like an alien in this universe. The more I examine the universe and the details of its architecture, the more evidence I find that the universe must in some sense have known we were coming.” The findings of modern science and the wondrous discoveries of all history suggest a purpose in nature “and that in some way we were built into it.” Over course, not everyone agrees with his thoughts, nor am I arguing here one way or another. The uniqueness of all of creation and the supernatural circumstances by which they thrive accurately depict the fullness of God.

John 1:16 relates that from his fullness, the whole glory of God in all his goodness, we receive “grace upon grace.” The purest way God shows his fullness is by his grace toward humanity. Who among us, when wronged by someone else, has as our first thought to show grace? When Adam and Eve rebelled against him in the garden, he could have wiped them out and tried again. Like building a sandcastle, he could have just brushed them away. I imagine I would have if I was in that situation. But we know that God doesn’t make mistakes. God knew from the very beginning that we would deny him and muddy his holy name. SImply because he loves us and by the fullness of his majesty and power, has the patience to show grace upon grace as a testimony to his nature.

Ephesians 3:19 speaks of the fullness of God as a product in believers from the love of Christ. This love “which surpasses knowledge” was expressed by God when Jesus was nailed to the cross on our behalf. He bore the punishment meant for us so that we could be free. By this love, God made a way for his people who are now dead in sin because of their choices to be restored into perfect unity with Him. This action declares his fullness louder than possibly anything else. It is the single most charitable and selfless thing ever to be done. The Bible says that “while we were still sinners Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8). Or while we were yet his enemies, he died for us. Jesus laid down his life for the very ones who nailed him to that tree. That’s me and you whenever we sin. The greatest humanitarians haven’t come close to such an extension of love. Truly God’s love for his people embodies his fullness. 

It’s absolutely mind-boggling to me that God invites us to enjoy his fullness. Upon the gracious act of salvation, believers are brought into a relationship with God. Colossians 2:10 says that “in Christ you have been brought to fullness. He is the head over every power and authority.” Jesus offers his fullness to those who will abide in Him. As the fruit is sustained by the tree, so are people meant to find sustenance in Christ. This was the original plan in the Garden of Eden. And it’s still meant to be that way. When we abide in Christ and he abides in us, we may experience his power and love in their most potent form -- oneness with God the Father, Son, and Spirit. Therein lies the goal of this study -- to be transformed.

# Section One: Facing the Past

> “Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it? I am making a way in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland. The wild animals honor me, the jackals and the owls, because I provide water in the wilderness and streams in the wasteland, to give drink to my people, my chosen, the people I formed for myself that they may proclaim my praise”
> (Isaiah 43:18-21)

## CHAPTER ONE: Jesus is More Than Enough

Jesus is the center of the Christian faith. If Jesus is not who he claimed to be, if he did not defeat death by rising on the third day, then Christians are to be pitied more than any other men. Similarly, if we hope in Christ for personal gain in this life, we are lost (1 Cor 15:12-19). It is of utmost importance that we must check the source and direction of our faith and apply it correctly in life. Our goal as Christians therefore, is to be as like Jesus as possible, to be perfected by his blood (Heb 10:14) and abide in Him as a spiritual offering (Rom 12:1-2).
 
> “Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, ‘I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.’  (John 8:12)

People say that God works in mysterious ways. I suppose it’s true, especially concerning the context of Paul’s letter to the Romans. In it he discusses the sufferings of humanity and creation in conjunction with God’s sovereignty and forbearance. Evil and hardship exist, but God is faithful to help and lead us according to his will, “his good, pleasing and perfect will”  (Romans 12:2). 

I wrote this book because I needed to. During the COVID pandemic, I was so afraid and angry at the world, I just wanted to rest in his embrace like a baby being cradled. My shame gloomed over me and I couldn’t sleep. I was so focused on everything wrong in my life and needed a wake up call. God gave me the idea for this book one night while I was crying out to him for help. He said you already know the answer, you know to find peace from your anxieties -- abide in me as I abide in you, he said.

I started thinking about that word, “Abide,” and what it really meant. I thought of The Big Lebowski and his catchphrase, “the dude abides.” That wasn’t it. I thought of how citizens abide by the law. That wasn’t it. My imagination stretched a little and I thought of how paint abides with the wall. But that image didn’t offer truth either. Then I remembered Jesus’ story about the vine and the vinedresser. For reference you can turn to John 15:1-11. 

He uses a metaphor about a tree and its branches to explain the source of our life and spiritual growth. In verse 5, he says, “I am the vine, you are the branches. He who abides in me, and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing,” Aha! I said. Abiding is so much more than obeying, being passive, or dwelling with as the dictionary suggests. With God, abiding is to find one’s entire self in the supplication of his Spirit. Like an apple tree, the branches can’t produce fruit if they are not closely connected to the tree and its roots. The Christian cannot experience the fullness of his grace and peace nor do anything that honors God without being firmly rooted in Him.

When I was a young man, about 16, I was diagnosed with cancer and a terminal infection. A few months prior my mother passed away, enduring many types of cancer since I was very little. She was my hero and when she died, everything seemed to fall apart. And then getting sick myself so soon after, it looked like God was absent. But for the six months I spent in the hospital and another year and a half of treatment, God showed me the depths of his faithfulness.

The doctors told my father that I wouldn’t live. He said there was a complication with a surgery and I contracted a deadly bacterial infection in my brain and spine. He said there was no hope.

But God in his sovereignty knew the end of the story. During that time in the hospital, God taught me how to abide in Him. He taught me to trust him even when else fails. He taught me to remain joyful amidst hardship and to look to Christ Jesus as my goal. He showed me who he is, that when I am weak,  he is strong.  God becomes your strength when you lean on him in Jesus Christ alone.  And I suppose that's what this book is about, learning how to abide in Christ and be transformed by discovering truth and living sacrificially.

### Good News!

The book of John teaches, "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him. Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God" (3:16-18). God desired to be restored to us so much so that he gave up what was most precious to Him so that we might be saved from a punishment we fully deserved. 

Paul adds in Romans, "but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us" (5:8). Verse 10 emphasizes how we were enemies of God! And he paid the price for us anyway! Never before has something so miraculous happened! Humanity is cursed by the power, presence, and eternal punishment for evil. 

This is the result of our disobedience against God. But God does not tolerate evil, so he threw humanity out of the Garden of Eden and into the world where there is all kinds of suffering and sadness. Now without God, we are doomed. Not only life a burdened life on the Earth but to exist in eternal torment in Hell. This is the fate of all humankind. So even though we are evil and enemies of God, without hope and without excuse, he of his own accord wanted so badly to be reunited with us that he opened a way for us to be redeemed.

But according to the law of God which he gave to the Hebrews, “there can be no forgiveness without the shedding of blood” (Heb 9:22). God is a just God and cannot break his own laws. And no simply animal sacrifice would work, as people did in the Old Testament to temporarily cover their wickedness. We needed a miracle. Nothing short of that could save us from our eternal doom. 

Can you imagine the resounding joy in the crowds when Jesus came to Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and everyone shouted, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!” (John 12:13). Because they called him “King of Israel,” it’s thought that they expected Jesus, the Messiah, to be a political deliverer and free the Jews from Roman oppression. But he came to save us eternally, not temporarily. There are so many instances in the gospels where Jesus stands on his authority over evil and death and forgives people’s sins. And most vividly, on the moment of Jesus death, when something happened in the temple: “And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom” (Matt 27:51).

The veil was a barrier in the temple between the presence of God and the people. Long story short, the sacrifice God paid on our behalf severed that chain and made a way for us to approach God and be restored as if still in the garden! To be freed from sin and doom and be brought into new life forever!!!!!!!!!

But knowing this good news as so many of us already do is not enough. This is why I’m writing this book: to document my own journey and to help others find transformation in the light of the Son. Just like being aware of a box of bandaids in the drawer isn’t enough to cover a boo-boo, we must respond to our need for forgiveness and seek Christ first, above all else (Matt 6:33).
Forgiveness and eternal life in Heaven are not given to us freely. These came at an insurmountable cost; the life of God’s own son and very being. Even though we couldn’t possibly repay God for his kindness, he does expect something from us. When Jesus was a young man, he “went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. ‘The time has come,’ he said. ‘The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!’” His message is for us as well, so many years after. Repent and believe!

Paul gives a long exhortation about what it looks like to repent and believe (Rom 8:1-17). He describes all people as fitting into two categories, those with the mind of flesh and those with the mind of the Spirit: People who set their minds on what the body desires and people who set their minds on what the Spirit desires (vs 5). The end result of these desires, Paul concludes, are death and life respectively. Only by trusting in the redemptive power of Jesus does the Spirit give life (vs 11). Because of this gift, we have a duty in life: “but it is not to the flesh, to live according to it” (vs 12b).

This pushed me toward a study identifying the desires of the flesh and Spirit and what the Bible says they produce. For instance, desire for wealth and luxury makes one dependent on such things and creates gaping holes in a person when they’re not readily available. Consider the link between econmic recession and suicide. This is why it says in 1 Tim 6:10 that the love of money and greediness “pierces” the person “with many sorrows.” It is the root of all evil because it encourages the person to think and do things contrary to their own well-being. Consider even the person of great economic fortune. They are often under such stress that thereM is no room for happiness; identity based on gain logically leads one to never being satisfied with what one has. 

Scripture narrows down the product of every desire of the flesh. Adversely are the products of desiring the Spirit as seen below. To abide in Christ we must abandon the desires of the flesh and seek after the Spirit: “O man of God, flee these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness” (vs 11). The mind of flesh is overwhelmed with darkness; it it there is no light. But by the gracious Spirit of God, faith cures our fear, hope enlights our shame, joy overwhelms all anger and so on and so forth. Let this be the starting point for study. We cannot abide in Christ if we are held prisoner by the mind of flesh.

Are you still living in the flesh according to the desires of your heart? Or do you belong to Christ and now live a new life in the Spirit? Jesus says that you will know them by their fruits. Are you more faithful, hopeful, joyful, humble, peaceable, and loving? If there is anything in you that is holding onto fear, shame, anger, pride, hatred, or lust, do all you can to purge yourself and put on Christlikeness -- “this is your true and proper worship” (Rom 12:1-2)

Paul, one of the most persecuted and forlorn Christians mentioned in the Bible, declared with certainty,  “I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through him who gives me strength” (Phillipians 4:12b-13). Do you live everyday like Paul, looking to God for strength? Or are you so torn with self-pity that you see yourself as the victim? Vulnerability before God is vital! Don’t allow yourself to make excuses as I have for so long.

As a side note, “But God” is likely the greatest transitional expression in all of the Bible. Follow the thought of this passage:

> “And you were dead in the trespasses and sins in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience—  among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.” (Eph 2:1-3)

Not a very nice picture of humanity, is it? Doesn’t offer much hope, does it? Now look at the next verses:

> “But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ—by grace you have been saved”  (Eph 2:4-5)

> “But God” is everything for the believer. It’s not like we were drowning and God gave us a raft to climb on. No, we were at the bottom of the ocean floor, DROWNED, dead as dust. But God, rich in mercy, love and grace, offers us life: 

> “The chastisement for our peace was upon Him, And by His stripes we are healed” (Isa 53:5)

> “But God proves His love for us in this: While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8)

But God, being rich in mercy, gave up his son, knowing full well that the very one’s he’d die to forgive would torture and kill him! He sought to satisfy justice and put away sin once and for all. It is a moment of tragic irony-- that the Messiah, the one the Jews were waiting for, the only one able to take away our iniquity, would die by the same sinner’s hands. And I’m not so sure it would be any different if you or I were instead of the people that condemned him. 

This is why we rejoice at the cross, it is forgiveness! This is why we rejoice at the empty tomb, it is freedom! Jesus is everything for the believer, and stands as our inspiration for living radically and carrying out the great commission. Without Christ, the cross, and the empty tomb, there is no hope. Without God’s great forbearance in sending his son, there is no life for anyone. Without Jesus, we are nothing. This is why we love Jesus, why we praise him and thank him for hours and hours! Recognize this: without Jesus, there is only death. We would not have forgiveness and so, would all be condemned to an eternity of suffering in Hell. So take a moment to thank God for Jesus!

Before I came to a place of peace and rest in God’s promises, bitterness consumed me. I was blinded to the rich life God offered. I knew God, but holding onto sin kept me from experiencing his fullness. I was in love with thinking myself a victim. I was in love with the darkness of pride and was therefore dead. But God! Being rich in mercy! O Lord, how great is your name in all the Earth! I’m so thankful for his mercy and grace! God raised me to new life physically by curing my cancer and infections. Exponentially more important, he gave me new life in the spirit. Jesus became the propitiation for you and for me! He shines like the sun in his radiance and glory! Where sin and death once reigned, Christ is king.

The doctors, my family and myself only saw the one outcome. We were all like children, nearsighted and ignorant. Thankfully God looks through a different lens. He is our good Father and knows what we need. Oftentimes we tell him the things we want, thinking they are essential. At the time I asked God to save me from my cancer when what I really needed was for him to save me from my sin. It’s not just a three letter word, it’s an impassable barrier between myself and God and only by the blood of Jesus am I forgiven and am now able to approach the throne of God’s grace and innumerable blessings. Thank you Lord for my cancer, for it brought me to a place where I could understand the depths of my sin and my great need for your saving grace!

Yes God healed me from my cancer. Yes he blessed me with life. But how much greater is the blessing of being forgiven! To be united with God by the blood of Jesus! All I can say is thank you, Lord, because there’s nothing in me that is worthy! “O wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death? I thank God—through Jesus Christ our Lord!” (Rom 7:24-25). This is why I say it’s all about Jesus! This is why the world needs Jesus! This is the climax of all history! This is why he is more than enough! Whatever you’re looking for in life, Jesus is more. Whatever you’re lacking, Jesus is enough. So walk with me through an in-depth examination of our hearts before God and seek to put off the old self which is rotten with sin and put on the righteousness of Jesus Christ that saves. 

What follows is a series of self-inspections. To be transformed our minds must be renewed, as Romans 12:2 teaches. To be transformed we need to let the Holy Spirit flow through us by putting away fear, shame, anger, pride, and all sin. And walk in the newness of life by Jesus’ example, faith, hope, joy, humility, and love above all. 

The first and most formidable enemy to following after Christ, is fear - our starting point to being transformed.

## CHAPTER TWO: Fear

It’s strange how normal things like a washing machine can be terrifying to a little child. Fear transforms simple things into dangerous monsters, even for adults! Why do people jump out of their skin when they see a spider? Odds are high that it’s not aiming to hurt you, nor can it. But for some reason they’re a source of great fear. Simply put, “fear is an uneasiness of mind, upon the thought of future harm likely to befall us. Fear is the passion of our nature which excites us to provide for our security, on the approach of evil.”  It, however, has no place in our lives because of Christ.

> The Lord is my light and my salvation— whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life— of whom shall I be afraid?”  
> (Psalm 27:1)

A famous study from 1973 conducted by R.H. Bruskin Associates found that American’s fear public speaking more than death. The subjects of their survey would rather die than give a presentation! That is the crippling effect of fear. The pressure of public speaking overwhelmed these people so intensely and likely clouded their judgement, because I don’t think a person, if presented the task of presenting in front of a crowd, would really rather die. 

Right now in this time of Covid 19 fear plagues the entire world. Thankfully we have the vaccines now, but just a few months ago, the news was ablaze with violent warnings. Stay inside! Don’t go out! Be afraid, be very afraid! Fear drove us to attack each other. Social media blew up with arguments and discord, blame shifting and name calling. Whatever your stance on the matter, it stands that fear has power, especially when there is little understanding.

This makes me think of that scene in Home Alone where Kevin goes into the basement and sees the furnace. In his imaginings, it’s malicious and alive. It growls and roars at him and becomes a great threat. Later in the movie, he confronts his fear and finds that the furnace is nothing more than just that. Not all of our fears are so easily thwarted, however the solution is the same. If we frame our fears in the truth of God’s sovereignty, they cannot stand. In the light of the Son, darkness cannot stand (John 1:5). Confront your fears, give them no power by acknowledging his.

How do we do this exactly? A lot of times the deep things of life are impossible to understand fully, especially the depths of the mind. And fear is so widespread! A study conducted with Chapman University to discover the most common fears in America found that “In 2018 and 2019, all the top ten fears were held by more than half of Americans. There has been a noticeable increase in people who share these fears. The study concludes, “Americans are becoming more afraid .” I can only assume the percentages have gotten worse with the rise of COVID and isolation. And not only so! According to a 2021 study by Mental Health America, people are reaching out for help with anxiety and depression more than ever. Of all the groups surveyed, young people ages 11-17 ranked highest for moderate to severe symptoms . Contributing factors are the COVID virus, money concerns, and the top factor, deprivation of social interaction: “From April to September 2020, among people who screened with moderate to severe symptoms of anxiety or depression, 70 percent reported that one of the top three things contributing to their mental health concerns was loneliness or isolation,” myself included!

When she was alive, my mother was my hero. She was my foundation and stood in the place of my heart only God deserves. So whenever her condition relapsed, fear of losing her drove me mad. Fear of being left alone kept me bound. There were many times when suicide crossed my mind, thankfully (and ironically), I was too afraid to go through with it. That anxiety stayed with me long after she died, manifesting primarily in prolonged isolation and nightmares. I was participating in church, even serving in youth ministry during those years, and nothing seemed to help. I was sans help, helpless even, to live the fearless life I was called by God to live.

This is a hard truth to swallow: when we fear, we sin against God. Jesus said, “Be anxious for nothing!” This is a command. When we submit to our fears and worries instead of God, we are in direct disobedience. And sinful fear creates sinful worship. If I’m afraid of heights (which I am), I’m bowing to the power of my fear instead of resting in Him. If I’m uneasy around big dogs (which I am), I’m letting my fear get the best of me. 2 Timothy 1:7 teaches, “God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.” When I’m afraid, I deny the spirit God gave me.

I remember so many times when I was tempted to fear in the hospital. Like I said, I was there for six months, and feelings of powerlessness loomed in my room all of the time. I remember feeling caged by uncertainty. But God did not give me a spirit of fear. God did not put me in that place to wallow in self-pity or to cast blame on the hospital for letting me get that deadly infection. Simply put, God put me there for an eternal reason: to get my heart submitted to him and to be a testimony to others of his faithfulness.

Beware of being caged by your fears. To fight fear we need to understand fear. I came across two anagrams which offer a proper perspective. The first is this:

### False Evidence Appearing Real

Anderson (1999) shares an example. He talks about a man who grabbed a snake off of the ground and put it in a jar as a trophy. He later discovered that this particular species of snake is very poisonous and nearly had a heart attack (p. 14-15). In order for a fear to present a legitimate threat,  it must possess two qualities: immanency (nearness) and potency (powerful). Our fears are no longer legitimate when one of these attributes is removed. Scripture teaches that we have no need to fear because God removes one of these attributes. For example, the reality of death is imminent, but the power of death has been broken (1 Cor 15:54-55) (Neil Anderson, 1999, p. 14; 15; 16). When truth is applied, fear disappears. 
 
I am not afraid of drowning, nor of bears, nor any danger around me because I’m not afraid of being hurt or killed. This DOES NOT mean I have no understanding of the danger or run to it. To fear is to obsess irrationally and give the object power over your peace. To have caution is to have a healthy awareness of our surroundings and any present danger, maintaining control. I don’t think the man in the story would have picked up the snake had he known it was poisonous. Had he had caution, he would have avoided the snake and fear would not have taken root. Most of our fears revolve around things we can’t control. Trust God, who is in control of all things at all times, and there is no need to be afraid of anything!

The truth of scripture understands fear as a matter of submitting. It is a sin to be controlled by fear because in doing so, we worship something else. People fear living without, so they worship money. We fear not being accepted, not being beautiful enough or successful enough, so we idolize celebrities, magazine models, and people like Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. We fear creepy crawlies and other scary things because we do not fully understand God’s design and so idolize our own preferences. Do you think Adam and Eve were scared of the carnivorous beasts and harmful plants around them? Of course not, because they knew that God was with them and everything he made was good. To have a correct perspective, we must change our thinking on such things. Romans 12:1-2, famous passage, says, “Do not conform to the patterns of this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind so that you may test and approve what is the will of God, what is good, pleasing and perfect.” Reorienting one’s fears in light of God’s presence and the amazing gift of his son Jesus brings salvation and healing and is the first step to transformation. Unholy fear manifested horrors in me; it’s power was terrible. It will take charge over your life, but only if you let it. But God (there’s that transitional expression again!) used that fear for a purpose in my life, and I believe he can do the same for you.

### Fighting the Enemy

> “Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble in dread before them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you. He will not fail you or abandon you” (Deut 31:6).

To put off fear, we must put off fearful thoughts. Think about the things you are afraid of. Maybe write them down. And think about why you are afraid. Then ask yourself, how can I change this thinking to reflect God’s sovereignty and goodness? Consider the second anagram that I changed to reflect the spiritual reality:

### Faith Equips Against Rival

Insteading of attributing power to your fears, recognize your humanity in light of an omniscient God who knows exactly what you’re going through and has power to relieve you, not just from the fear but from its source! 

We know from scriptures the true identity of our enemy. It is nothing physical that we war against as Christians. We do not fight against each other or against the world, “but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this age, against spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” (Eph 6:12), against Satan, the ruler and prince of this world. His purpose is singular, to get in the way of God’s plans by hindering the Church. His primary method of attack is lies (John 8:44) and he will continue to do so until his inevitable defeat at the end of the age (Rev 20:7-10).

We know from scripture that God is sovereign over everything, including the devil. We know from scripture that the only reason Satan still threatens us is because God allows it (Job 1:6-12), because that’s what humanity chose instead of God (Gen 3). And so, because of the reality presented to us upon birth, we as a church have a decision to make. Sin, temptation, evil desires, lies, etc. exist, however much we may not want them to. Will we submit to them and live as the rest of the world does, for the fleeting moment? Or will we endure hardship and fight for the sake of knowing God and being made into the likeness of Christ for an eternal dwelling?

> “Be alert and of sober mind. Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith, because you know that the family of believers throughout the world is undergoing the same kind of sufferings” (1 Peter 5:8-9)

When we rest in faith and trust God in the midst of fear, our minds are renewed with transformed thinking. Worldly fears, when submitted to the sovereignty of God, become examples of divine thankfulness and trust. Pick one of your fears and apply transformation using the examples below.

### Worldly Fears
1. Turbulence! Oh, no, the plane might crash! I don’t want to die!
2. I don’t want to go in the water. What if I drown?
3. I don’t trust my significant other. I'm afraid they’re cheating.
4. I’m afraid of dogs because I got bit once.
5. I lost my job! It’ll be months before I can find another one! How will I feed my family?

### Transformed Fears
1. Thank you Lord for everything you've given me. I trust you completely. Give me strength to get through this flight
2. Thank you God for your good creation. I acknowledge my fears are based on the worst circumstance, not on any intrinsic qualities of the water. Help me to conquer my fear. Please keep me safe, O Lord
3. Thank you Jesus for your amazing love. Thank you that you will never leave me nor forsake me. Help me to trust my significant other and help us grow together in righteousness for your name’s sake.
4. Thank you almighty God for your good creation. Everything you made reflects your creativity and wisdom, even the smallest little bug. Help me get over my fear. I acknowledge that my isolated incident does not apply to all dogs.
5. Thank you Lord for my family. You know I care for them deeply and don’t want them to suffer. I trust you to provide for us as your Word promises. I trust you will work all things for the good of those who love you and are called according to your purpose (Rom 8:28). Please help me find work and in the meantime, set a good example to my family by being thankful and joyful.

Notice how all of these fears are based around uncertainty. Notice how they can all be reworded as “What if” statements. And notice also how the worries can honor God if we place them in his hands. He desires that we share our burdens with him. He is there to comfort and guide us. Psalm 55: 22 instructs, “Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved.” 

In every trial let us call upon the Lord, and he will save us. To cast our burden upon God is to rest in his sovereign promises. And when we choose, instead of fearing, to trust God, he is faithful to sustain us amidst the most terrible struggle. He will impart to our spirits the strength and perfection of his divine Spirit so that we may glorify him as image bearers. As redeemed Christians, we are Christ’s ambassadors and ought to live our lives in remembrance of him. “He will never suffer the righteous to be moved, to be so shaken by trials as to forget their duty to God or their comfort in him. He will not suffer them to be utterly cast down. He, who bore the burden of our sorrows, desires us to leave to him to bear the burden of our cares, that, as he knows what is best for us, may provide it accordingly.”

### Fear God Who is Eternal, not the Temporary World

Irrational fears, the ones we discussed above, are never good. But fear can be a good thing, when rightly understood. See what Jesus says, speaking to his twelve disciples,

> “Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather, be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell. Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care. And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows” (Matt 10:28-31) 

In Jesus’ time, sparrows had little cultural importance and were a cheap source of food for poor families. 

Luke reiterates Jesus’ words in 12:4-7: “I tell you, my friends, do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have nothing more that they can do. But I will warn you whom to fear: fear him who, after he has killed, has authority to cast into hell. Yes, I tell you, fear him! Are not five sparrows sold for two pennies? And not one of them is forgotten before God. Why, even the hairs of your head are all numbered. Fear not; you are of more value than sparrows.” 

The point remains, if God cares so deeply about a little bird with little worth, how much more so will God take care of you, his most prized creation! So don’t consider the sparrows of the world a threat to your livelihood, but consider the one who created them and intended them for a purpose, who created you and intended an eternal life for you! Do not choose eternal death by following after the sparrows!

To fear God is not to be afraid of him. It is simply to acknowledge him for who he truly is.

There are so many instances in scripture where fear of the Lord imparts blessing and wisdom to those who have it. So what is it, really? Because we have such a negative connotation of fear, it can be hard to attribute it to a loving God. Fearing God doesn’t mean we fear him like we do darkness, spiders, or other scary things. I think it means three things: 

(1) It means that we acknowledge who he is as the Alpha and Omega, creator of the universe, omnipotent and omnipresent. Revelation 1:17 reads. “When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. He put his right hand on me and said, ‘Do not be afraid. I am the First and the Last.” 

(2) It also means that we acknowledge who we are as sinners who deserve only his wrath because of our disobedience. “But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars--they will be consigned to the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death” (Revelation 21:8). 

(3) it reflects our genuine appreciation of his grace because of this discrepancy. The Bible says that “while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.” Another way to interpret this is, ‘while we were yet his enemies.’ God gave us everything, even when we deserved the exact opposite! So rejoice! Be thankful for his amazing grace! Yahoo! I’m forgiven! Thank you Jesus! 

In our culture, we see everything from a point of legal rights. As a citizen, I feel I have the right to a lot of things which in reality, I don’t. I have the right to a fair trial. Try and tell that to marginalized communities. I have the right to express my opinions. Not in this cancel culture you don’t. I am endowed with natural rights like the right to own property and the right to question the government. Think about all the small businesses that have been shut down for not conforming against their religious beliefs. We are so quick to judge that too often rights are infringed on. And too often do we bring this sense of “I deserve better” into God’s economy. Because of our national rights, we assume God gives us rights as well, and when things don't go our way we complain and blame God. We can’t possibly understand his unrequited love with a legalistic frame of mind! This is fear of hardship, not fear of God. This is worshiping selfish expectations, not submitting to God’s “good, perfect, and pleasing” will. And you say again, “How is hardship ‘good, perfect, and pleasing?’ Obey God, wait it out, and you’ll see! God did not create you to have an easy life. He created you to glorify Him by living the set apart life, and we’ll get into that in the third section later in the book. 

Remember in the Old Testament the many steps the Israelites needed to take before they could approach God? Remember the complicated sacrifices they had to make to cover their sins? Remember how the glory of God instilled fear in their hearts? They did not take his holy presence lightly and had a clear understanding of his great mercy and his wrath against unrepentant sin. God is a god of love AND justice. Fear of the Lord acknowledges his deity; take heed, lest we forget and lose our way. 

Jesus warns near the end of his sermon on the mount, “Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many enter through it. But small is the gate and narrow the way that leads to life, and only a few find it” (Matt 7:13-14), and again a few verses later, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven (Matt 7:21). Here he reminds us of the severity of God’s command to be righteous, to walk through life as reflections of his glory. I was listening to a pastor on the radio the other day and he was talking about the kingdom of God as represented in revelation, how the city is built with the purest gold, onyx, diamond, topaz, emerald, jasper. And how the glory of God reflected off of them with unimaginable magnificence. He talked about how people are like those jewels, that the light of God’s glory is refracted through us into knowable colors, godly characteristics. 

> “Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. And we, who with unveiled faces all reflect the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into His image with intensifying glory, which comes from the Lord, who is the Spirit” (2 Cor 3:17)

I wonder, what is the shade of God’s glory in you? Is it bright and clearly visible, or is it dim or maybe even transparent? Do you have a right fear of the Lord so as to honor and obey him and glorify him?

Fear of the Lord is undeniable proof that you are set apart as his. It is holy and does away with sin. Fear of God is rightly revering his authority and power. We fear his wrath against sin; we love his saving grace. And so we submit to His will and keep his commandments. Rather than give power to death, danger, discomfort or uncertainty, we give it to whom it is properly due, to the one who is able to deliver us from all of these things. In short, the fear of God is to fear nothing else.

> “God’s fear is properly in men’s hearts; but here the sense seems to be this, that this fear, i.e. his dreadful manifestation of his majesty and justice, (the act being here put for the object,) may be now and ever before your eyes, and in your memories, as an effectual preservative from sin.” 

By this commentary, we can better understand what the fear of the Lord does: it preserves us from sinful worldly fear! And even this, that many of my fears can become joys! As in suffering for the building up of God’s kingdom or denying myself to love others better. Because I no longer fear death or pain or rejection, I can boldly proclaim the good news of Jesus with boldness! I can serve God behind the scenes with an unsurpassed sense of fulfillment. Fear of missing out no longer directs my choices: I can now spend my whole day reading the Bible and praying and enjoy the far richer blessing of communing with God, even though I could be watching TV or hanging out with friends. It is now my greatest joy to serve God, whereas before I would serve myself and my own desires. 

> “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you."  (Psalm 56:3)

Through my earthly fears, God revealed my deep weaknesses and great need for Christ. By renewing my thinking (Rom 12:1) with believing in the power of Jesus’ death, burial and resurrection, studying the Bible, prayer, and fellowship with the saints, God transformed my heart and mind from life in the flesh to life in the Spirit and obliterated my fears. Because of his grace and perseverance working in me, I have the power to choose boldness and put away fear.

My prayer for you is that you would see God more fully in the scriptures. That He would impart wisdom and discernment to you, and that your worldly fears would be replaced with fear of the Lord.

I remember trying to read the Bible in my youth, loving the stories and famous passages but loathing the law and the prophets. “It’s so boring! Where’s the action? Give me David and Goliath! Give me Noah’s Ark!” Now having a better understanding of the entirety of scripture, those boring passages have come to light! Jesus is the fulfillment of all scripture and his presence is clearly seen in every chapter. The author and perfecter of our faith, the climax of the Bible and the hero of the story appears even in the Old Testament laws about food. Christ’s death, burial and resurrection met the letter of the law for all people, past, present, and future. Now because of the Son, God sees us as sinless, perfect creatures! This is not an excuse to continue sinning, but what relief! Because of Jesus, I am not held accountable for my sin nature but am given a new nature that exudes light and life! So be anxious for nothing! Do not be afraid of death, for it is the gateway to eternal life with God! Do not be afraid of suffering, for it is the means of so many spiritual blessings! Don’t worry about tomorrow but trust in God’s many perfect promises!

> “And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? … Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble.” (Matt 6:27 ; 34)

> “Rejoice in the Lord always, again I will say rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone, the Lord is at hand; do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.” (Phil 4:4-7)

> “Who among you fears the Lord and obeys the word of his servant? Let the one who walks in the dark, who has no light, trust in the name of the Lord and rely on their God.” (Isaiah 50:10)

## Chapter Three: Shame

### Sin, Guilt, Shame, and Doubt

The words Guilt and Shame are often intertwined with the same meaning. And though the difference is subtle and often missed, they do have distinct meanings. To experience guilt is to be held responsible. It is a legal term that locates the action of misdemeanor onto a specific person. To feel shame is to bemoan and deplore one’s self, not necessarily his or her actions. It is the painful feeling caused by awareness of wrong behavior. The two words are closely linked-- shame typically follows guilt. 
	
Imagine you are driving and a police officer pulls you over for speeding? When the officer explains the nature of your grievance, do you say, “Yeah, you got me. I’m guilty.”? Or do you try to weasel your way out of a ticket? We are not so quick to hold ourselves accountable. Only after you receive the ticket do we admit, “I shouldn’t have gone past the speed limit!” Depending on the strength of your conscience, you may guilt-trip yourself for bad behavior, but usually the regret doesn’t come until after we’ve been proven guilty. No one feels ashamed of something they didn’t do. In fact a person is likely to get offended if you accuse them unjustly for that very reason.

In the case of our sin against God, it is all too easy to get caught in a loop of shame. Knowing the depths of my sin is a shoo-in for spiraling self-blame and condemnation. Not only that, but also that it is because of my own personal sin that Jesus had to suffer and die on a cross. My guiltiness before the throne brings me to my knees. And if I stop there, it is hopeless! Isaiah, the Psalmist, and Paul personally feel the weight of their imperfection, and the guilt is deep:

> “Woe is me, for I am undone! Because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts” (Isa 6:5) 
> “If you, LORD, kept a record of sins, Lord, who could stand?” (Ps 130:3)
> “What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death?” (Rom 7:24)

Sin, which leads to guilt before God, which leads to shame before ourselves, which leads to doubt about our salvation or about God or our ability to measure up to his or others standards, which allows sin, guilt, and shame to deepen and the cycle continues. What will stop this swirling pool of sin? 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89104596/129847163-dcd955e1-da15-4870-a2e1-d3a38c136cd7.png)

Thankfully, the story doesn’t end there. Trusting God in the midst of suffering and our inability to please God brings great growth. Focusing on His goodness instead of their problems, Isaiah, the Psalmist, and Paul exemplify trust and peace:

> “Lord, you are my God; I will exalt you and praise your name, for in perfect faithfulness  you have done wonderful things,  things planned long ago” (Isa 25:1)
> “But with you there is forgiveness, that you may be feared” (Ps 130:4)
> “But thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then I myself serve the law of God with my mind but with my flesh I serve the law of sin” (Rom 7:25)

Isaiah acknowledges God’s faithfulness and responds in faith; the Psalmist experienced God’s forgiveness and trusts in His grace; Paul found transformation from death to new life through Christ and so can we!

Freedom is a foreign concept to many people around the world. So many live in countries that violently oppress their citizens. North Korea is notorious for how ruthlessly it tortures its people. Its many prison camps alone are enough to raise the most indifferent souls to alarming concern . Not to mention withholding basic needs like food and personal freedoms, even the most basic right to life is threatened by public executions!  Those of us living in America can hardly imagine this kind of political persecution. We may be bold enough to say we experience it slightly, but never to that degree!

Thankfully, God offers an eternal solution that is not focused on the suffering we experience during this short lifetime, but during the great expansions of eternity! God offers freedom from the penalty of sin and eternal suffering in Hell (a legally just punishment for any sinner). Out of his goodness and love for his people, (you know the story), God gave us his son to be punished on our behalf.  Because of this, and in keeping with the topic, we no longer need to bear the burden of sin nor guilt nor shame nor doubt. The simple truth is Jesus already did it for us. We no longer have to worry. I realize this isn’t as easy to practice as it is to say. We must relearn it everyday, lest we fall into the category below:

> “His divine power has given us everything we need for a godly life through our knowledge of him who called us by his own glory and goodness… But whoever does not have them is nearsighted and blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their past sins” (2 Peter 1:3; 9)

The “them” Peter identifies are qualities of the growing Christian (2 Peter 1:5-8). Have we lost our way so badly, are we so nearsighted and blind that we have forgotten the great sacrifice of Jesus and the power of God to forgive our sins? Are we so caught in the power of shame that we’ve lost our identity in Christ and now place it in our sins? I know from personal experience how easy it is to fall into legalism and hold ourselves harshly accountable for past sins, especially habitual sins that are challenging to get rid of. How arrogant am I to say God is not able to forgive me! That was the depth of my shame and its malevolent power! It was so potent in my reflections that I limited God’s power. 
	
I remember one of the first students I had as a volunteer youth teacher came to me so upset about his inability to live perfectly according to God’s commandments. He was so distressed; he couldn’t understand how God could change his heart, or forgive him at all! This kind of shame is debilitating to your faith. Imagine how Adam and Eve must have felt! Instead of running to God as children, Adam said, “I was afraid, because I was naked.” (Gen 3:10b). When our sins and shortcomings are revealed, it does feel like we are defenseless, naked like they were. Think about how it must’ve felt to be kicked out of paradise, how you would loathe yourself for sinning against God! If only you could go back and have a do over! 

Or think about how Peter felt after denying Jesus three times. On the night of Jesus’ betrayal, Peter promises that he would lay his life before betraying his Lord (John 13:37). Later that very night, as Peter is accused of being one of the disciples, he does the opposite of standing up for Jesus. He does not lay down his life, but denies any and all association with Jesus. He is more afraid for his own well-being than for his so-called ‘Lord.’ But unlike the story of Adam and Eve as told in the Bible, Peter grew to understand the power of God’s grace. Though Peter most likely lived with great shame for selling out his Savior, God still had a purpose for him. 

When Jesus returned after being crucified, he came to Peter: ‘“He said to him the third time, ‘Simon, son of John, do you love me?’ Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, ‘Do you love me?’ and he said to him, ‘Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Feed my sheep’” (John 21:17). Just because we hold onto guilt, that doesn’t mean God holds judgement against us. He is faithful to forgive if we would be honest and humble before him.

Jesus is the ultimate example for Christians to follow. Not just in his holiness, but how he fought against temptations to sin. We read in Matthew 4:1 that he was led by the Spirit, of whom he was full, to be tempted in the desert. Famous theologian and philosopher Thomas Aquinas reasons he did so for four reasons. His first three reasons are to strengthen us against temptations, to be warned against temptations, and to teach us how to overcome temptation, and fourthly, to fill us with confidence in his mercy. Jesus is our example and inspiration for holy living.

Hebrews 4:15 confirms, "We have not a high-priest, who cannot have compassion on our infirmities, but one tempted in all things like as we are, without sin." God does not look down at his children, not even the worst of us, with contempt or remorse, wishing us never to have been born. He loves us unconditionally and is faithful to sanctify and perfect us in our faith. On the other hand, free will dictates that the burden is on you to choose. God opened the door by opening your eyes, now you have to walk through.

> “Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm you calling and election, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall” (2 Peter 1:10)

### Freedom is a Verb

It’s said that you can lead an animal to water but you can’t make it drink. In order to experience true unity with the Father and like-mindedness with the Son and Spirit, we must be vulnerable and submit before the cross in all humility! Holding on to shame is holding onto doubt. When I told Matt about the shame I held onto because of how I offended him, he taught me about vulnerability and the great power in forgiving one’s self. This might simply be new age philosophy, but I think it’s very applicable to the topic. The Bible never speaks directly about forgiving yourself, only about trusting in Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross for forgiveness and the command to forgive others. What it really comes down to is do I trust God? Do I trust his plans for my life?

An excerpt from Baker’s Dictionary of Theology reads, “The New Testament deepens and expands the concept of shame. A disciple of Christ stands with him unashamedly in a world that finds the cross (Heb 12:2), God's ways (1 Cor 1:27), and God's persecuted messengers (2 Timothy 1:8; 1:12) shameful. Those ashamed of him now will find Christ ashamed of them on the day of judgment (Mark 8:38; Luke 9:26). Conversely, God is not ashamed to call the faithful "brothers" of Christ (Heb 2:11).” 

At the cross, our worldly shames are taken care of. At the cross, we put on a new type-- we stand united with Christ wholly unashamed. Shame of sin is cast on the Lord who is faithful to bear the weight of all our burdens. And we go unto the world, unashamedly sharing his love with others.

Ask yourself: Do I trust God enough to stand naked before him, showing all of my weaknesses and shames? Am I too ashamed to pick up my cross and follow Jesus’ example? Do I love God enough to do what he commands, despite my many weaknesses? Will I continue to serve God even when the world turns it’s back on me and looks down at me with shame? 

When I read Paul’s epistles, I’m overwhelmed with the grace of God. When I read James, I’m overwhelmed with responsibility. Paul often opens his letters by identifying himself as an apostle on a mission. He blesses the churches with grace, peace and mercy from God the father and Christ Jesus. James starts his letter identifying himself as a slave and servant of God and of Christ. He encourages his readers to welcome trials and sufferings as a means to test one’s faith and so produce steadfastness which , in its full effect, makes one “perfect and complete, lacking in nothing” (Jam 1:4). 

The two views are sides of the same coin. Yes, we must rely heavily on God’s grace, peace, and mercy! Yes, we must take responsibility for our faith! Yes, no one is saved by works alone but only by the blood of Jesus are we forgiven and so have entrance into the kingdom of God. Yes, works confirm our salvation and as ambassadors, we honor God by living righteously. I don’t know that any of us are able to stand when things get rough, only by his power and mercy are any of us still alive! Neither do I know any bible believing Christian who is content to go live atop a mountain, just them and Jesus. We are commanded to go, therefore (Matt 28:19), not, keep the blessing of truth for yourselves! So take off the shame that so hinders your mission, O Christian! 

I can recall the exact moment God revealed this truth to me. I was deep in the cycle of sin and self-condemnation! Like Paul I recognized the battle raging within me: In my heart of hearts I so desire to serve God. But I still have this human weakness that so desires to serve its lustful desires. He admits in desperation: “I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do.” He goes on, “For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do-- this I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it” (Romans 7:15; 18b-20). 

Matthew Henry comments on the passage, “the apostle did not mean that men are not accountable for their sins, but he teaches the evil of their sins, by showing that they are all done against reason and conscience. Sin dwelling in a man does not prove its ruling or having dominion over him. If a man dwells in a city or in a country, still he may not rule there.”  It is the eternal battle, good vs evil, only inside every reborn Christian; the old self at war with the new spirit. Sin is still alive and well in us. It is how Adam and Eve could sin so directly against God, how Moses could commit murder, how Peter denied Jesus, and how Ananias and Sapphira could lie to the Holy Spirit. Every one of us is just a step away from committing grievous sins. So we must meet the enemy wherever he is. 

> “Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world” (1 John 4:4)

Wearing shame is accepting defeat. But because of God’s sufficient grace (2 Cor 12:9), we can wear his forgiveness and mercy instead. As we learn to offer our shame to God, our trust in him grows, and lasting victory over sin is sure to come. There will always be sin in the believer, but if we trust him, he is faithful to sanctify us more and more into the likeness of his son, Jesus. 

You gotta act freedom out and apply it before it becomes real. You can be free and not know it! Don’t let shame overwhelm you so that you become like 2 Peter 1 and forget that you have been cleansed of your sins, once and for all. Instead, stand on God’s promises. Therefore, practice Paul’s wisdom from Philippians 3:12: “but this one thing I do-- forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead.”  

## Chapter Four: Anger

Nothing makes Americans more angry than other Americans. We live in a time dominated by political correctness and anyone who doesn’t fit into your particular mold is an enemy. There are about 328.2 million people living in this country, and it seems like each person is divided from the other. Democrats and Republicans are like two opposing armies, it’s gotten so bad! What happened to “one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all”? I think the last time I heard the national anthem was in elementary school, twenty years ago. Look closer at the words in that statement of identity:

> One Nation
> Under God
> Indivisible
> Liberty and Justice
> For All

The picture is of a unified body of people with a unified purpose and unified plan. I don’t recall this ever being the case in all of American history. World War 2 is often remembered as a time of unification in the states, a common people with a common enemy. But listen to this veteran: "The army was an experience unlike anything I've had in my life. I think of two armies, one black, one white. I saw German prisoners free to move around the camp, unlike black soldiers, who were restricted. The Germans walked right into the doggone places like any white American. We were wearing' the same uniform, but we were excluded" (Dempsey Travis). Unfortunitely, this idealistic image of a single body of people has not been the reality for some time. We are a nation of individuals and have created a new pledge, the pledge of internal disunity.

> 328.2 million separate individual nations
> Under 328.2 million separate authorities
> 328.2 million sovereign borders
> 328.2 million beliefs or interpretations
> For 328.2 million preferred sociopolitical groups

Anger divides us on so many levels and it stems from pride. People on different sides of an issue lash out with detestable speech and feel justified to do so. We get so caught up in our personal beliefs, thinking ourselves right, that we lose sight of Jesus’ message to the world. Life becomes all about lme versus all about living for God and others like Christ. And being angry with God when things don’t go according to our plans is a common pitfall as well.

My heart broke in half when my mother died. It broke into quarters when my mentor moved away. It broke into eighths when my best friend left the church. And it became like dust when all that tension in my heart exploded. I wallowed in distress for all that had happened, and the missing hormones in my brain made it even more difficult to deal with the stress. I spent many sleepless nights, had many angry conversations with God in my car. I remember how I would often sit in my car and shout “this sucks” over and over, expressing my defeat. I felt like Atlas who bears the weight of the world on his shoulders. But unlike Atlas, instead of holding it up, it crushed me. I collapsed under the 13 billion trillion tons of iron and carbon, much like a bug finds itself suddenly pressed into a single atom upon a car windshield. Letting my problems get the best of me, the force of my anxiety struck me into pieces like the moving car.

Through much much much (so much!) prayer and reflection, it became clear that the root of my brokenness was obsession with how things used to be, and anger about how things are now. When mom died, it was like it wasn’t real. Intellectually I knew she was gone, but I don’t think I ever accepted it. Intellectually I knew my brothers had simply moved on with the next phase of their lives, but in my pride I took it personally and held onto that bitterness. I was never angry with God about my cancer or infection or about nearly dying; being the youngest, I was a momma’s boy and admired my brothers like heroes; familial problems hurt me the most.. (These words are particularly difficult to type, I think because I still hold onto that obsession with how things used to be… Lord, continue to work in me.)

Anyways… anger can be very subtle and is often missed or not identified as an issue at all. When I was in my car I wasn’t thinking to myself, “Why am I so angry?” but “this sucks, this sucks.” I never stopped to think that the problem could be with how I digested the preceding events and was so quick to cast blame and absorb the pain that comes with as a result of unforgiveness. Anger hides under nearly every negative emotion. It hides beneath past hurt, loss, and regret. It lingers alongside guilt, all sadness, and all insecurity. It was hard for me to identify. Even today, I was driving and thinking about hurt in my past, things that were said to me, uneasiness that I still held onto, and I thought, “Why does all this still upset me?” I’m reminded everyday that the past is far in the past and this keeps me chained. “Why can’t I move forward?” What happened next was groundbreaking. 

### God Convicted My Heart!

Paul teaches in Phillipians 3:12, “Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me” In that moment of confusion in my car, I had to make a resolution: either I dismiss the thought and continue to cast blame and boil in anger or I forgive, cast that burden on Jesus, and “press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me” (Phil 3:12). The answer is not as obvious as it may seem. In my heart, I did not want to forgive! I wanted to be like that disgruntled employee who quits with a fiery speech. I wanted my enemies to bear the burden of my pain. That is the way of sinful flesh. The way that God commands us to follow is the narrow and difficult path. It’s easy to dismiss the command to love others when you’re angry. Instead of “Lord bless them,” it’s “Lord, did you see what he did? Did you hear what she said?”

But to press on is to put the past behind you and look forward to what is in front (Phil 3:14). To press on is to leave everything and follow Jesus, just as he called his disciples. Of Simon and Peter, scripture recalls, “At once they left their nets and followed him.” (Matt 4:20). Of James and John, it says, “immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him” (Matt 4:22). And again: “As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s booth.  ‘Follow me’, he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him” (Matt 9:9).

But not all would follow so willingly:  “Jesus told him, ‘If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow Me.’ When the young man heard this, he went away in sorrow, because he had great wealth” (Matt 19:21-22). 

Also in Luke 9:59-62: “Then He said to another, ‘Follow Me.’ But he said, ‘Lord, let me first go and bury my father.’ Jesus said to him, ‘Let the dead bury their own dead, but you go and preach the kingdom of God.’ And another also said, ‘Lord, I will follow You, but let me first go and bid them farewell to those who are at my house.’ But Jesus said to him, ‘No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God’” 

What are you holding onto that is more important than following Jesus Christ? For me sitting in my car, it was anger about my past, and I had to give it up. He does not call us to live in anger or regret. He already set us free from the penalty and power of sin, and as an homage to a friend of mine who loves to imitate the stylings of Pastor Derek Prince, if you want to be free, well, be free, you see.” Freedom from anger and all burdens comes in denying yourself, your fallen human instincts, and seeking a higher one in the only true God.

> “And calling the crowd to him with his disciples, he said to them, ‘If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it’” (Mark 8:34-35)

When we choose to follow Jesus and live by his example, we must first leave everything else behind. That is to say, we need to forget what was so important to us before, and behold him and his purposes at the forefront of our minds. Like many others, my mother was my first love. She was everything to me. Part of God calling me to himself was loosening my attachment and idolization of her and applying it to my relationship with him. But when she passed, I was so angry. I kept holding on, even though she was gone. I was too angry, resentful, frustrated, hurting, and sad. It’s strange how these negative emotions give us comfort. I was so used to operating in these boundaries it was uncomfortable and strange to live any way else. I didn’t want to let go of my pain because in a way, it felt like letting go of my mother. I was too selfish and unwilling to give to the Lord what was rightfully his from the start.

In comparison to unity with God, nothing else should matter. Nothing should keep us from following him with everything we have. Whatever you’re holding onto, beware that it doesn’t get in the way of your first duty to abide in God, which is to accept or act in accordance with his ways. The phrase “abide in me,” Jesus commands his people to remain fervent in seeking him and to dwell richly in a loving relationship with him. Barnes notes on the Bible translates the phrase: “Remain united to me by a living faith. Live a life of dependence on me, and obey my doctrines, imitate my example, and constantly exercise faith in me.” 

Following Jesus and imitating his example is more of a ‘just go and do it’ more than think hard about how to do it. As Jesus says in his famous Great Commision, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go…” When we trust him and obey by stepping out in faith, he is faithful to do the hard work of changing our own hearts and the hearts of others by speaking and acting through us. All we have to do is say,  "yes, Lord" and go. So start today if you haven't already by putting away fear,  shame and anger. 
Crossroads
	
I understand it's a lot harder than it sounds,  or as it is just to write the words down as I am doing now. It's taken 28 years for me to get to this point, and I’m just beginning to let go of my deepest desire to control. There is indeed a cost of following Jesus. So often in life one must give before one may receive. Think about exercise, it’s difficult and painful, but we do it because we desire the results. Same goes with studying; homework and testing are merely road signs to gauge our progress. Some would say it gets easier as you continue further. A few years ago I went back to school and got my master’s degree. It was NOT easier, haha! Although you learn tricks and tips along the way that help you with future tasks, the burden of sucking it up and doing it is always there. 

One of those tips in following Jesus' example and obeying God rather than man is to look at your life from God’s perspective. We see things as past, present, and future. God sees them all at once because he is eternal and not bound by the limitation of time or space. Thinking about things from this point of view takes the edge off big decisions; my destiny is not temporal like this job, it is eternal life in Heaven [if I trust God and repent.] After a point you begin to see everything in this light and by the grace of God your desires and sentiments change.  When you cognitively and spirituality give control of your life into God's hands, things you were once obsessed about and often lament (like me and missing my childhood bond with my brothers) become less and less a burden. Anger you've held onto for so long looks less and less attractive. The same goes for all of the words in the circle above; they become deep hidden sins when we choose to idolize and keep them in our hearts. Be free,  O Christian! In Christ there is freedom,  so be free from all anger. So look again at that image, examine every word, and give it to God.

Humble yourselves, therefore, under God’s mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you (1 Peter 5:6)

> "Cast your burden on the LORD, and He will sustain you; He will never allow the righteous to be shaken" (Psalm 55:22)

> “So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand and says to you, Do not fear; I will help you” (Isaiah 41:10, 13)

> "Never worry about anything. Instead, in every situation let your petitions be made known to God through prayers and requests, with thanksgiving. Then God’s peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in union with the Messiah Jesus" (Phil 4:6-7)

It’s the picturesque moment of a father and child walking together holding hands. It is a picture of the father’s protection and care and, when we hold onto his hand, of the child’s trust and confidence! Will you stand before him bereft of any emotional walls? Will you take hold of his hand as he takes hold of yours? Let go of your anger and all its disguises! Say, “Yes, Lord,” and commit to follow him, and he will do the rest.

> “And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me” (Luke 9:23)

What God values and what the world values are diametrically opposed to one another. To be holy is to be set apart from the things the world desires. Like I said, there is a cost to following Christ. To take up one’s cross is to carry your death, to be willing to suffer and die for the sake of holding Christ as your Savior. The world would say that this is too great a cost. At the cross of Christ we come to a turning point, the climax of the story! It is the ultimate crossroad: two choices leading to two eternal destinies. It becomes a blessing for those who would submit and obey or a curse for those who would not (Deut 11:26-28). Heaven is not just escaping punishment, it’s enjoying God’s perfection forever, and is the reward for following Jesus. Neither is Hell just a one time death and it's over. It’s eternal suffering, dying forever, and is the reward for disobedience.

Denying yourself is an act of obedience whilst nurturing your sinful tendencies is not. If you want to follow Jesus, you must deny your natural inclination to sin. Deny your natural inclination to be angry and to hold onto hate. Deny the power of anger to magnify past hurt, past pain, past guilt. To deny yourself is to press on! Let the past be in the past, and choose new life. I love Paul’s conviction when he writes in Hebrews 3:13, “But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called ‘Today,’ so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness.” As long as it is called ‘Today,” live out the example of Jesus.
